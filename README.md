# ESPGIF
ESPGIF is a project which uses an ESP8266, and an SSD1351 OLED display to display a GIF! This project has the Arduino Code and a tool to convert the GIF into a byte array.
# How do I use it?!
This a quick tutorial on how to use the library.
## Step 1: Setup
You will need:
- Hardware - 
  - An ESP8266
  - A SSD1351 OLED display
- Software -
  - Python 3.7
    - The [PILLOW Library](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)
    - [TKinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) (comes preinstalled with newer versions of python)
  - Arduino IDE
    - I have a repository with the modded Adafruit GFX (Allows for fast SPI transfers)
    - The Adafruit_SSD1351 library
    - Note: Both of the libraries are bundled in the "libraries" folder.
 ## Step 2: Setting the stuff up
